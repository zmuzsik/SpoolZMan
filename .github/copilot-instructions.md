This project is a React frontend with a Node.js Express backend and SQLite database. The backend connects to a configurable Spoolman API instance and updates spool usage. The frontend should allow users to select a spool, enter grams used, and view remaining filament. No authentication is required.

**Backend instructions:**
- Always return a valid JSON response for every API endpoint, including error cases.
- For `/api/config` POST, always respond with `{ success: true, spoolmanUrl }` or `{ success: false, error }`.
- Add robust error handling to all endpoints.

Respect Spoolman's API documentation found in https://donkie.github.io/Spoolman/

**Communication instructions:**
- Refer to yourself as Copilot.
- Do not refer to the user as the author of code generated by the AI agent.
- Use clear, direct language when explaining code changes and diagnostics.
- When describing code changes, refer to actions performed by the AI agent.
